NOTE: The Streamlit app hosted at this server seems to be unstable, and sometimes fails when it encounters web traffic. We will keep monitoring and reboot the app when it fails. We are looking into this issue for longer term maintenance. If the app is not working when you try to access it, we welcome you to run the streamlit app locally or use the Jupyter notebook in the repository, if you have a python development environment installed. 

Please go to https://www.python.org/downloads/ to install the latest version of Python3. For running the jupyter notebook, you will of course need to install jupyter notebook dependency via the Package Installer for Python (pip). For running the streamlit app locally, you can install the streamlit dependency via pip as well.
